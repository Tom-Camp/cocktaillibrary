  notes:
    - All recipes are based on a 100ml (3.5 fl oz) mixed drink and are made for drinking vessels of approx. 150ml-200ml (5-7 fl oz). 1 bar spoon equals approximately 5ml, whereas a dash amounts to approximately 3ml or.5 bar spoon.
steps:
  - step:
      Put the whisky in one mug and the boiling water in the other.
  - step:
      Ignite the whisky with fire, and while blazing mix both ingredients by pouring them 4 or 5 times from one mug to the other.
  - step:
      Sweeten with one teaspoon of powdered white sugar, and serve in a small bar tumber, with a piece of lemon peel.
notes:
  - If well done, this will have the appearance of a continued stream of liquid fire.
