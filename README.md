# Open Recipe Cocktail Library

A collection of cocktail recipes in the [Open Recipe Format](https://open-recipe-format.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). There is an [index](index.md) of recipes [here](index.md).

## Prerequisites

You will need to know a few cocktail recipes and you can look up YAML on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=yaml&t=h_&ia=web).

## Contributing

Create recipes and place them in the `recipe` directory. Create pull requests. Grow the library.

## Running tests

Mix cocktails and then test them. Cheers!

## Updating the index

Updating the index requires `Python 3`, other than that simply `cd` into the root directory and run `./createindex.py`. The script will read all of the _yaml_ files within the _recipes_ directory and list them on the `index.md` file.
